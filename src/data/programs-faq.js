        Most of the time, yes! We reserve seats for men at some of our in-person
        events and our online communities. However, TechLadies Mentorship and
        TechLadies Bootcamp are just for women and those who identify as one due
        to the resource limitation.

    details: (
      <>
        We did not create TechLadies to make money, but we need money to keep
        TechLadies going. As such, we charge for some of our programs and
        events. We provide full scholarships for women with financial
        difficulties and cannot afford the fees.

        No, you don’t. As long as you can legally be in the country to take part
        in in-person events, you can join us! Do note that we cannot help with
        your visa applications.

        We focus on helping women enter and grow in the tech industry. If you’re

        Yes! We are on a lookout for community leaders who are passionate and
        committed to bring TechLadies to their cities. If you’re able to build a
        team and execute on TechLadies’ programs locally, please reach out to
        Elisha at elisha@techladies.co.
