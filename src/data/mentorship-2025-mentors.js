            I'm an ambitious engineering leader with 10+ years of industry experience. I have always been fascinated by the world around, the everyday interactions and the role of technology in making life effortless. This interest has driven me to develop a keen eye for user design and user experience, along with making my visions into reality by building them with code. I enjoy tackling complex problems and finding solutions and intricate edge case scenarios for the problems and actively use technology for the same.

‚ú± I spent 10 years in Singapore, 6 years in Indonesia, and 16 years in Korea. I'm the OG Third-Culture Kid ü§ò
‚ú± I say hellos, pleases, and thank yous to my GPTs and ask them to pick a name (it picked the name ‚ÄúElis‚Äù)
‚ú± I'm really really really scared of cockroaches. Fantastic trait to have when you live in Singapore. I get panic attacks, so I wouldn‚Äôt joke about them if I were you üò¨
‚ú± I don't say this about any of my talents, but my music taste is out of this world. Chefs kiss
‚ú± I am sensitive both mentally and physically, so I have things like IBS and anxiety from time to time. But it also means I‚Äôm meticulous and can read rooms well. I‚Äôve learned to embrace this trait as a strength, not a weakness ‚≠êÔ∏è
‚ú± Family is my most important treasure! 
‚ú± I like travelling to cities with nice parks. My favourite cities so far include Paris, Melbourne, and Tokyo ‚Äî some call it basic, I call it classic
‚ú± I collect postcards, moderately priced prints, and Stitch figurines. I really adore Stitch, I wish I could have him as a pet
